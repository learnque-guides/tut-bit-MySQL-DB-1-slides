# Missing value

* Two-valued predicate logic, a predicate is either true or false. If a predicate is not true, it must be false. 
* Three-valued predicate logic refers to the three possible logical values that can result from a predicate—true, false, and unknown.
* SQL implements three-valued predicate logic by supporting the NULL marker to signify the generic concept of a missing value.
* In MySQL, a NULL value means unknown. A NULL value is different from zero ( 0 ) or an empty string '' . A NULL value is not equal to anything, even itself. If you compare a NULL value with another NULL value or any other value, the result is NULL because the value of each NULL value is unknown.
