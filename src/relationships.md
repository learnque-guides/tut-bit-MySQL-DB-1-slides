# Relationships (intro)

There are several types of database relationships:
* One to One relationships,
* One to Many and Many to One relationships,
* Many to Many relationships,
* Self Referencing relationships.

**One-to-One** relationships occur when there is only one record in the first table that corresponds to only one record in the related table.

**One-to-Many** relationship is defined as a relationship between two tables where a row from one table can have multiple matching rows in another table.

**Many-to-Many** relationship occurs when multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table.

**Self-referencing** is a relationship that exists between the records within a table.

We will speak more about relationship later. This is just introduction so you would be aware about main terminalogy.
